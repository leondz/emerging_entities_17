As you mention , it the fact that the first polariser ' converts ' unpolarised light to polarised light that does the majority of the perceived attenuation . For an interesting test ( for the OP who has the sheets .. ) , take the first two sheets and arrange them as a crossed polariser at maximum extinction , then insert a third polariser between them at a 45 degree angle . What happens and Why ... ?
@notstoreboughtdirt - Probably not . " [ C]onduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator " does n't cover anything related to the job they will be taking or specific facts or commentary on the nominee 's qualifications . It only restricts discussing *things that were done* ( conduct ) or the *reasons for them* ( motive) . So " You have no experience with _______ " is valid , but " You took bribes from the _____ industry " is not .

I think the question is a bit restrictive , as it implies the *contents* of the emails are the only factor that may be significant , and precludes , for example , consideration of how having the emails drip-feed to the press meant drowned out other stories that may have been good for clinton or bad for trump . Suggest rewording it as " how could the release of the hacked clinton/DNC emails have influenced the election outcome ?"

In my judgment , the goal is to determine the torque about the COM . This can then be set equal to the angular acceleration times the moment of inertial about the COM .

I think this answer is wrong — I certainly took it to be meant literally .

This isn’t *that* unrealistic for an item’s value ( as a gift , it kind of is though) .

@knzhou lets take light of 500nm . In the single slit ( width = 0.1 mm) , we find the first maximum at an angle of 0.286 degrees . Now lets take a diffraction grating of the same width with 1000000 slits carved into it . The equation : dsin(x)= ( lambda) . d=10^-10 . Now the first maximum does not even appear on the screen . These are 2 very different results . Did i miss something ?
How much information is stored in a genome and how much in the distribution of genomes in a species ?
I disagree with MAC address filtering and SSID broadcast . Turning off SSID broadcast means that the SSID will be broadcast during communications . You only turn of the periodic beacon and thus you **lower** your security since rogue AP are now easier . As for MAC-address filtering : Active MACs are also broadcast . No added security . Lastly , chaing the name is a good idea , but if I see a WAP with the ID ' Belkin ' and a wireless radio with a MAC from Cisco then I also can figure that out .

However , I think you have some creative leeway here given just how complex the paths of rays near a black hole can be . Best of luck

And 2 ) I'd overwrite the stick or sd card after use , not terminate processes or reboot .

This is a good answer , but it would be improved by emphasizing the administration’s reaction to the controversy—a swift apology would have meant a thiry-second story soon forgotten , with most people unwilling to assume antisemitism for what *could* ( if we 're being very generous ) have been a mistake . But by owning it as intentional and refusing to apologize , they eliminated the possibility that they were being misunderstood , and indicated that it *was* intentionally antisemitic .

@jmac That is a very good point well made . Far too often people perceive executives as good for nothing morons that do n't understand anything . As a general rule anyone who has made it to the position of an executive must have some experience and results to show . While how much money a person makes is not a perfect measure of general competence it 's a fairly decent indicator . At the very least they must have been competent at getting the job of an executive which is more then most of us can say .

Outside for two minutes , he would see a drift of 2362 metres , well enough to take him away from the ship .

Masses are then expressed in units of 1000 sun mass . I.e. $M = 1$ means $M = 1000$ sun mass , and $m_i=1/N$ means $m_i = ( 1/N ) 1000$ sun mass . Just put the sum mass in $kg$ in the formula for $m_i$ and $m_i$ is in $kg$ . The real diameter is set by the physical situation you are considering , e.g. the diameter of some galaxy .

A good indicator could be some sort of metric like this : " Per severity level , percentage of CVEs resolved/closed within 30 or 60 days of opening ".

( tagging @user21820 as well ) All devices eventually succumb to entropy . An electric motor with its magnetic fields may collapse very quickly . The chemically bonded structure of the rock will collapse very slowly ( potentially outlasting the door , depending on materials) . However , for when a normal 16 year old OP asks a question like this , they probably assume the rock lasts " forever ," which is a very reasonable approximation for most situations short of geologic timescales .

I agree with you for free electrons . For atoms I 'm inclined more to the observed charge neutrality due to canceling out the protons and electrons fields .
